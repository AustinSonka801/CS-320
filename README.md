How can I ensure that my code, program, oor software is functional and secure?
Throughout the process i have tested the code in the course , some times i tested multiple times to ensure everything worked properly. I also followed the requirments to make sure that the program is close as possible to what the customer demands.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I read what the user is asking for and then look at their needs. After getting this information i will then break it up into smaller task then start in one area then move to thre next when i have confidence that the area met the customers needs.

How do I approach designing software?
My first step is reading the requirements then look at the overall project then i would break it up up into smaller work loads. Then i would start coding the first area and then move onto the next once the area is working properly. Once all these areas are done and fully coded then I can put them together like a puzzle.
